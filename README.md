# Decentralized_Identity_Verification-
This repository will show my step-by-step process as I build a decentralized identity verification software. Check back every week for new updates to the software.

Today, we made significant progress in developing the decentralized identity verification project. We focused on the backend implementation using Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. We created a comprehensive Solidity smart contract that allows for identity verification, access management, expiration control, age requirements, and authorized document types. We also added additional features such as access revocation, document removal, and event emission for important contract actions. The contract was thoroughly tested and enhanced for security and functionality. This sets a strong foundation for the project, enabling secure and decentralized identity verification. Tomorrow, we plan to continue working on the frontend implementation and integrating the smart contract with the user interfaces.
